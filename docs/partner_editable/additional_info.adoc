When the AWS CloudFormation stack is ready, return to the Deep Security console, where your accounts are imported. The console displays all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances running in these accounts in addition to the structure of VPCs and subnets across all Regions.

== Post-deployment steps
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading
Teams must know how to deploy agents. This deployment is intended for high-risk workloads, such as public-facing systems and infrastructures that support critical workloads. Deploy the agent by navigating to *Help > Deployment Scripts*. 

//TODO The following sentence is unclear. Revise.
UNCLEAR: For longterm scale, build agent deployment into AMI baking, application build pipelines, or other automation already in use within account owner teams. For more information, see https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/computers-add-deployment-scripts.html[Use deployment scripts to add and protect computers^] and https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/agent-baked-in.html[https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/20_0/on-premise/agent-baked-in.html^].

== Cleanup

To remove the Control Tower lifecycle hook, delete the AWS CloudFormation stack. Managed accounts are protected and will reamin in place. For more information, see the https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/docs/workload-security/[Workload Security Documentation].

If you want to remove all managed-account protections, invoke a `remove_all` event to the lifecycle hook before deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack.

. Log in to the AWS console for your organization's AWS Control Tower management account.
. Open the AWS CloudFormation console.
. Navigate to the `WorkloadSecurityLifeCycleHook` stack, and open the *Resources* tab.
. Navigate to the `LifecycleEventHandler` row. Its *Type* value is `AWS::Lambda::Function`. To access the function, choose its accompanying link to open the Lambda console.
. In the Lambda console, choose the *Test* tab, and create a new event using the following payload:
+
....
{"InvokeAction":"remove_all"}
....
+
. Choose *Invoke* to trigger the lifecycle hook with the `remove_all` event payload.
. To verify that the protections are removed, review the output logs. 

== Self-Hosting

Some customers may want to host the Quick Start content locally to ensure that the reviewed code deploys. To host this Quick Start, complete the following steps:

. Create a bucket in the Region where AWS Control Tower is deployed. The bucket can be owned by any account as long as the AWS Control Tower–management account can access the content.
+
WARNING: If your bucket is not in the same Region as AWS Control Tower, stack deployment will fail.
+
. Copy the AWS CloudFormation template into your bucket. Use the key `quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security/templates/Trend-Micro-Cloud-One-Workload-Security-Lifecycle-QS.yaml`.
. Copy the Lambda function deployment package into your bucket. You can add a prefix, but the object path must end with `functions/packages/c1ws-controltower-lifecycle.zip`. Use `quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security/functions/packages/c1ws-controltower-lifecycle.zip`.
+
[TIP]
====
Use the AWS command line interface to copy your content.
....
aws s3 cp --recursive \
    s3://aws-quickstart-us-east-1/quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security \
    s3://your-bucket/quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security
....
====
+
. Ensure that your content conforms to your organization's best practices. To review the properties for each resource you create, navigate to the AWS CloudFormation stack. You may want to read the source code for the Lambda function to see what it does.
. Launch the AWS CloudFormation stack in the same Region where you deployed AWS Control Tower, and add its URL to the template. In the parameters, replace the default value for *Quick Start S3 bucket name* and *Quick Start S3 key prefix* with you bucket's name, including the prefix of the bucket where your content is stored. By defaul, the prefix is set to `quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security/`.

WARNING: If you deploy the stack in a different Region than your AWS Control Tower, the lifecycle function will not receive events when new accounts are created or removed. It also does not automatically add or remove accounts in Conformity.
