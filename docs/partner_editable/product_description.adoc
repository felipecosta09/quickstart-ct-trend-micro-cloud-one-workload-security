Using a set of REST APIs, Workload Security facilitates deployment, policy management, health checks, and compliance reporting. Integrations with Amazon EC2 API endpoint and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) automate discovery and visibility into workloads in every AWS account, while Amazon SNS provides a mechanism to programmatically respond to security events at scale. The Lifecycle Hook solution provides AWS CloudFormation template which, when launched in the AWS Control Tower Management Account, deploys AWS infrastructure to ensure Workload Security monitors each Account Factory AWS account automatically.
