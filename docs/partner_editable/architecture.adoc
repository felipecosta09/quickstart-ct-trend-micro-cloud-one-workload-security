* Admin enrolls new or existing AWS accounts into AWS Control Tower, which generates Lifecycle event with new account details.
* The Lifecycle event triggers the Lifecycle Lambda function via the EventBridge rule to set up the new CloudOne integrations.
* Lifecycle Lambda function assumes the role into newly created AWS account and creates a cross-account IAM role and registers the new AWS Account with CloudOne Conformity endpoint.
* The API keys used to authenticate with the CloudOne endpoint are stored in the Secrets Manager in the Management account.
