* An administrator enrolls new or existing AWS accounts into AWS Control Tower, which invokes a lifecycle event with new account details.
* The lifecycle event invokes the lifecycle Lambda function via an Amazon EventBridge rule, which sets up a new Cloud One integration.
* The lifecycle Lambda function adds a role to new AWS accounts and creates a cross-account IAM role. The Lambda function then registers new AWS accounts using a Cloud One Conformity endpoint.
* API keys authenticate the Cloud One endpoint.
* AWS Secrets Manager stores the API keys in the management account.
