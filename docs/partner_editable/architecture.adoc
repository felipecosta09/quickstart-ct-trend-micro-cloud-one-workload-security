* An administrator enrolls new or existing AWS accounts in AWS Control Tower.

* AWS Control Tower invokes AWS Service Catalog to create a managed account and generates an Amazon EventBridge event rule.

* The managed account contains a cross-account role that management account can assume using AWS STS.

* EC2 instance in the Managed account is not created as part of the Quick Start. It represents any workload instances that are protected by this Quick Start deployment.

* The Amazon EventBridge event rule invokes a lifecycle Lambda function, which creates a new AWS account role through an AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) resource. It registers the new account using Cloud One endpoint.

* AWS Secrets Manager stores the API keys to authenticate with the Cloud One endpoint.
