* An administrator enrolls new or existing AWS accounts in AWS Control Tower.
* AWS Control Tower invokes AWS Service Catalog to create a managed account and generates an Amazon EventBridge event rule.
* The managed account contains a cross-account role that the management account can assume through AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS).
* In the managed account, the protected Amazon EC2 instance is not created as part of this Quick Start. It represents any workload instances that are protected by this deployment.
* The Amazon EventBridge event rule invokes a lifecycle Lambda function, which creates a new AWS account role through an AWS STS resource. The Lambda function also creates a new Workload Security endpoint.
* AWS Secrets Manager stores the API keys to authenticate with the Cloud One endpoint.
