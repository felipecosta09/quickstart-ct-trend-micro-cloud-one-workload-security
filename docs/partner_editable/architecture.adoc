* Administrator enrolls new or existing AWS accounts in AWS Control Tower, which generates a lifecycle event with new account details.
* A lifecycle event triggers a lifecycle Lambda function through an Amazon EventBridge rule to set up a new {partner-product-name} integration.
* A lifecycle Lambda function assumes the role for new AWS accounts, creates a cross-account IAM role, and registers the new AWS account with Cloud One conformity endpoint.
* API keys that authenticate with the Cloud One endpoint are stored by AWS Secrets Manager in the management account.
